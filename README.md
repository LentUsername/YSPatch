# YSPatch
Patches for updating YandereSimulator without redownloading the whole thing.

Releases contain binaries of an open source tool xdelta3: https://github.com/jmacd/xdelta

Apply patches by extracting the archive into the game folder (.) and running .\YSPatch-AAAAA-BBBBB\ApplyPatch.cmd

The script does not need to run as administrator unless access to game folder is somehow restricted.

The resulting game files should be identical to those which could be downloaded from https://yanderedev.wordpress.com/downloads/
